# WallStreetStockAnalysisVBA

**Summary:** VBA script to analyze real stock market data.

Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for three years for each run and take the following information.

-The ticker symbol.
-Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The total stock volume of the stock.


It also has conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

This script is also able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume" for every worksheet
